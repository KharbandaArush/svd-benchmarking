# svd-benchmarking

Assumptions
1. Since the platform will actually run on a AWS EMR Cluster and would use multiple nodes, hence using 4 node machines for benchmarking

Explaining Deviations
1. Since upto 4 cores a single machine is used and from 8 cores 2 machines are used, the time taken to run on 8 nodes could be more than the time taken to run for 4 nodes.
